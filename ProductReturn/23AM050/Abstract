The *Product Return and Restocking Management System* is a console-based Java application designed to streamline the process of managing product returns, inspecting returned items, and restocking inventory within a retail environment. Leveraging a structured object-oriented approach, this system uses key classes, such as `Return`, `Product`, `Customer`, and `Inventory`, to model entities and operations involved in product returns and stock adjustments. The system integrates a MySQL database for persistent storage of product details, customer information, and transaction history, ensuring data integrity and scalability.
The system supports both `CustomerReturn` and `StoreReturn` types, encapsulating unique requirements for each return type through inheritance. An interface, `Returnable`, defines essential methods such as `processReturn()`, `updateStock()`, and `generateReturnReport()`, ensuring flexibility for further enhancements. Custom exceptions like `InvalidReturnException` and `StockUpdateFailureException` are implemented to handle error conditions robustly, enhancing reliability in various transaction scenarios.In addition to core return and restocking functionality, the system supports concurrent return processing using multithreading, enabling efficient handling of multiple returns simultaneously. File handling is also employed to log return activities, providing an audit trail for analysis. Comprehensive reporting capabilities are included, allowing the generation of return reports that summarize returned items, customer details, reasons for return, and dates. These reports facilitate management insights into return trends, supporting operational and inventory decisions.
This project demonstrates the integration of Java, MySQL, and multithreading in a practical application for inventory management, offering a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for return and restocking operations.
